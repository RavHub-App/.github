## 🚀 Why RavHub?

RavHub is the modern alternative to legacy artifact managers like Sonatype Nexus or JFrog Artifactory. Built from the ground up for the cloud-native era.

- **🏠 Self-Hosted First**: Keep your artifacts on your own infrastructure (On-Premise or Cloud).
- **🛡️ Enterprise Grade**: RBAC, Audit Logs, and SSO included in the design tailored for compliance.
- **⚡ High Performance**: Built with NestJS and optimized for extreme throughput.
- **☁️ Cloud Native**: Native integration with S3, GCS, and Azure Blob Storage.
